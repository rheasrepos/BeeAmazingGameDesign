Note: all classes should implement game class
Classes:
Bee
Variables
speed (float)
posX (float)
posY (float)
size (float)
direction (int)
Methods
move()
Looped as long as gameActive in Game is true
Move by speed every second based on direction (0 = right, 1 = up, 2 = left, 3 = down)
changeDirection(take in key press)


Should trigger when an arrow key is pressed
Changes the bee’s direction to the specified direction 
checkIfHitWall()
Looped
Check if in contact with any walls by constructing lines from walls in Game and checking intersection (hitbox collision mechanics)
If true
Call decreaseTime in Game
checkIfHitPot()
Looped
Check if in contact with pots
If true
Call collect() in HoneyPot
checkIfHitEnemy()
Looped
Check if in (x,y) overlaps with enemies’
If true
Call die()
checkIfHitGoal()
Looped
Check if in contact with the goal flower
If true and currentLevel in Game classl < 4
Call nextLevel() in Game class
If true and currentLevel in Game class = 4
Call win() in Game
die()
Call gameOver() in Game
Walls
Collision mechanics
Variables
posX (float)
posY (float)
Width (float)
Methods
HoneyPot
Variables
Time (int)
posX (float)
posY (float)
Methods
collect()
Make honey pot disappear
Increase timer in Game class by 5 seconds
disappear()
Looped
Decrease time every second
When time reaches zero, make honey pot disappear

Level
Variables
beeSize
goalX
goalY
enemies (array of Enemys)
walls (array of Walls)
pots (array of HoneyPots)
Game
Variables

Methods
startGame()
Sets gameActive to true
Makes all elements visible (if not already)
Sets currentLevel to 0
Sets timer to 90
Uses first array of Pots
Uses first array of Enemies
Uses first array of Walls
nextLevel()
Increases currentLevel by 1
Goes to next array of Pots, Enemies, and Walls
decreaseTime()
Reduces timer by 10 seconds
tickTime()
Always active if gameActive is true
Looped
Reduces timer by 1 second every second
restartLevel()
Resets everything to the starting position of the level
decreaseBeeSize()
Decrease bee size to Stage[currentLevel].beeSize
timeRunsOut()
Looped
Check if timer = 0
Calls gameOver()
levelCompleted()
startNewLevel()
completeAnimation()
showPotTip()
Display guide about honey pots at specific level once they are unlocked
gameOver()
Displays game over screen
Sets gameActive to false
Display restart button
Calls restartLevel()
win()
Only happens when currentLevel is 5
Displays victory screen
Display restart button
Sets gameActive to false
Hide all other elements
